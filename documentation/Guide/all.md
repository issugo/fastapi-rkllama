# RKLLama Documentation

RKLLama is a server designed to run and interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized for Rockchip RK3588(S) and RK3576 platforms. Unlike other software such as Ollama or Llama.cpp, RKLLama enables models to operate directly on the NPU, enhancing performance. The current version of the `rkllm-runtime` library is V1.1.4, tested on an `Orange Pi 5 Pro (16GB RAM)`.
